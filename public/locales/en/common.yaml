    paragraph1: >
        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) expands upon the team-based first person shooter gameplay the original 
        Counter-Strike pioneered when it launched in 1999. Two teams compete in multiple rounds of objective-based game modes 
        with the goal of winning enough rounds to win the match. 
    paragraph2: >
        CS:GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers 
        updated versions of the classic Counter-Strike maps like Dust, Inferno, Nuke, Train, and more. In addition, CS:GO 
        introduces new game modes like Arms Race, Flying Scoutsman and Wingman, and features online matchmaking and Competitive Skill Groups. 
        This is the classic game mode that put Counter-Strike on the map. Two teams of five compete in a best-of-30 match using standard competitive 
        Counter-Strike rules. Players must purchase armor, weapons, defuse or rescue kits, and manage their in-game economy to maximize their 
        chance of success. The first team to win 16 rounds in either Bomb Defusal or Hostage Rescue game modes wins the match. Competitive offers 
        unique Skill Groups players can earn and display, beginning with Silver 1 and progressing up to The Global Elite. Join a match on 
        your own or form a team and queue for a match together!
