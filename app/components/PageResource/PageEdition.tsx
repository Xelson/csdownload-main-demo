In addition, CS:GO introduces new game modes like Arms Race, Flying Scoutsman and Wingman, and features online matchmaking and Competitive Skill Groups. This is the classic game mode that put Counter-Strike on the map. Two teams of five compete in a best-of-30 match using standard competitive Counter-Strike rules. Players must purchase armor, weapons, defuse or rescue kits, and manage their in-game economy to maximize their chance of success",

Counter-Strike has one of the largest fanbased communities backing it up, which quickly becomes apparent with a quick YouTube or Twitch search.",

			content: "People say valorant will replace cs go, but they are completely wrong. Csgo the the OG of all games on pc. This is easily the most fun first person shooter game on steam. It's free as well. Not only does this game impress me with its gun skins, knives, weapons, gamemodes etc. But it is also amazing how you can get custom maps from your steam workshop! You can change your crosshair, resolution, controls and, well, you can basically do anything. Amazing. This game has impressed me.",
